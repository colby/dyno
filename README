Dyno
===
Enough movement to get you where you need to go.

## WHY
Sometimes you feel like building a cabin with a bunch of tiny tools, dont you?

## TODO
* build index.html
* purging by death date
* updated post meta
* ~~EDITOR support~~
* basic css file
* monit/init support for daemon
* ~~cron.d scheduling~~

## Install
```bash
hub clone colby/dyno
cp dyno/dyno.sh /usr/local/bin/
cp dyno/dyno.cron /etc/cron.d/
export DYNO_PATH="$PWD/dyno"
```

## Uninstall
```bash
# but why?
rm -rf $DYNO_PATH/dyno
rm /usr/local/bin/dyno.sh
unset DYNO_PATH
```
