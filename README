Dyno
===

Enough movement to get you where you need to go.

## WHY

Sometimes you feel like building a cabin with a bunch of tiny tools, dont you?

## TODO

* build index.html
* purging by death date
* updated post meta
* ~~EDITOR support~~
* basic css file
* monit/init support for daemon
* ~~cron.d scheduling~~

## INSTALL

```bash
hub clone colby/dyno
cp dyno/dyno.sh /usr/local/bin/
cp dyno/dyno.cron /etc/cron.d/
export DYNO_PATH="$PWD/dyno"
```

## HOWTO

Create a dyno.
```bash
# takes a string of text, which is hashed into a dyno
./dyno.sh "This is a test!"
```

Edit a dyno.
```bash
# takes a dyno hash, loads it in $EDITOR
./dyno.sh a28bca1b906f539ba70ca3a0b1f2e773
```

Kill a dyno.
```bash
# takes a date string, in %s, kills any dyno older than %s
./dyno.sh 1584729329
```

## NOMOREINSTALL

```bash
# but why?
rm -rf $DYNO_PATH/dyno
rm /usr/local/bin/dyno.sh
unset DYNO_PATH
```
